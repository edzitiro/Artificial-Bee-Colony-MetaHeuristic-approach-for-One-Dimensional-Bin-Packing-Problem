# Artificial-Bee-Colony-MetaHeuristic-approach-for-One-Dimensional-Bin-Packing-Problem
This project is part of a published research (Metaheuristic Approaches for One-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem: A Comparative Performance Study) conducted on the use of metaheuristic approaches for one dimensional bin packing problem. An underlying heuristic Better fit sorts the items into bins and artificial bee colony finds the global optimal solution.  # CODE To find the global optimal solution, run the main method titled BinPackingMain. - Enter swarm size and number of cycles. These values determine size of the population being searched and the number of cycles determines how many times to search.
